Building Predator on Ubuntu
===========================
Note I do not use Ubuntu myself, so this howto may become outdated as time
passes by.  Any suggestions from real Ubuntu users on how to improve this howto
are welcome.

Please start with this, ONLY if you are on Ubuntu 10.04:

    sudo apt-get install timeout


This part is common for all versions of Ubuntu we have tried:

    sudo apt-get install cmake curl g++     \
        libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev  \
        gcc-multilib

    curl http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~idudka/download/predator-2011-10-11-8a7846b.tar.gz \
        | gzip -cd \
        | tar x

    cd predator-2011-10-11-8a7846b

    make -j3 build_boost build_gcc

    make -j3

    make -i check


Note you need approximately 2 GB of free disk space to unpack and build GCC.
The steps above were successfully tested on Ubuntu 11.04 Desktop (i386 and
amd64) and Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (Lucid Lynx).
