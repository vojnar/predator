Building Predator on Fedora
===========================

    sudo yum install cmake gcc-c++ glibc-devel.i686 gmp-devel libmpc-devel \
        mpfr-devel

    curl http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~idudka/download/predator-2011-10-11-8a7846b.tar.gz \
        | gzip -cd \
        | tar x

    cd predator-2011-10-11-8a7846b

    make -j3 build_boost build_gcc

    make -j3

    make -i check


Note you need approximately 2 GB of free disk space to unpack and build GCC.
The steps above were successfully tested on a fresh installation
of Fedora 15 x86_64.
