 * @file test-0001.c

 * @brief infinite loop creating a SLL
 *
 * - it plots a heap graph per each iteration
 *
 * - thanks to the SLS abstraction, the program reaches its end
 *   during the symbolic execution (though it can't happen in real
 *   world as long as there is some memory available)
 *
 * - junk is properly detected since there is some memory
 *   allocated, but nothing is free'd afterwards
