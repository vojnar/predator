Instructions for TACAS 2012 Competition on Software Verification
================================================================

(1) Build GCC and Predator from sources (takes up to 10 minutes assuming you
    have a fast enough Internet connection due to download of GCC and Boost).

    On Fedora, please follow the instructions in docs/README-fedora.

    On Ubuntu, please follow the instructions in docs/README-ubuntu.

    On other Linux distributions, please follow the instructions in README.

    If the build fails, please ask for support at idudka@fit.vutbr.cz.


(2) Use the 'sl_build/chk-error-label-reachability.sh' script to verify each
    single test-case.

    The verification result (SAFE, UNSAFE, or UNKNOWN) will be printed to
    standard output.  All other information will be printed to standard error
    output.  There is no timeout or ulimit set by this script.  If these
    constraints are violated, it should be treated as UNKNOWN result.  Do not
    forget to use the -m32 option when compiling 32bit preprocessed code on a
    64bit OS.
