-Predator
-========
-Predator is a practical tool for checking manipulation of dynamic data
-structures using *separation logic*.  It can be loaded directly into *GCC* as a
-*plug-in*.  This way you can easily analyse C code sources, using the existing
-build system, without any manual preprocessing of them etc.  The analysis itself
-is, however, not ready for complex projects yet.  The plug-in is based on Code
-Listener infrastructure (included).  Although Predator is intended to be as
-portable as GCC is, we support only Linux for now.  You can find the latest news
-on the following project page:

-Predator and Code Listener are licensed as GPLv3+, see COPYING for details.
+Code Listener
+=============
+Code Listener is an easy to use infrastructure for building static analysis
+tools.  Our goal is to wrap the interfaces of existing code parsers and provide
+a unified and well-documented, object-oriented API (Application Programming
+Interface).  The key advantage of our solution is that we allow building of
+analysers capable of handling everything that *GCC* is able to compile (unlike,
+e.g., the CIL infrastructure).  Additionally, there is no need to pre-process
+the sources, neither to change the way the sources are being built.  Hence, we
+make it easy to, e.g., run an analysis on a Linux kernel module or an
+autotools-based project, etc.  Our infrastructure is implemented as a C++
+library that can be used to build an analyser as a GCC *plug-in* (using the
+native GCC plug-in interface).  You can find the latest news on the following
+project page:

 Building from sources against the system GCC
 ============================================
 This method requires a build of GCC with plug-in support compiled in (not
-necessarily the system one).  The currently supported version of GCC is 4.7.0
-and the test-suite is guaranteed to fully succeed only against this version of
-GCC.  However, the Predator plug-in itself is known to work with GCC 4.5.x and
-GCC 4.6.x equally well.
